      "Pichu (ピチュー, Pichu) is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It was confirmed alongside Jigglypuff and the rest of the returning roster on June 12th, 2018 during E3 2018. While Pichu remains a full clone of Pikachu, it is not classified as an Echo Fighter. As such, Pichu is classified as Fighter #19. Satomi Kōrogi, Pichu's voice actress from the Pokémon anime and Melee, reprises her role with new voice clips. In addition, the 'spiky-eared' variant of Pichu (who appears as a playable character in Ultimate via Pichu's alternate costumes) is also voiced by Kōrogi rather than Shoko Nakagawa, who originally voiced the aforementioned 'spiky-eared' variant in the Pokémon anime's twelfth movie, Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life.",
